# 🧮 Quantum Annealing for Prime Factorization 

## 🛠️ Setup
To try it out yourself install the following packages with pip:
```
    pip install numpy sympy matplotlib pandas
    pip install dwave-system dimod seaborn
    pip install dwave-hybrid
    
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## 📖 Explaination
I stumbled uppon this rpository this morning semingly atr random while researching the weaknesses and strengths of Quantum Annealers. This semes to be like the title and filenames suggest a Prime Factorisation algorythm supposed to run on hybrif quantum-classical optimisers and is suggestably fairly strong at that. 

After further research this reasearch may be linked to the paper [Research on Quantum Annealing Integer Factorization Based on Different Columns by Baonan Wang, Xiaoting Yang and Dan Zhang](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2022.914578/full) which explains the approach used in this reposetory.

This fork exists to make this approach more accessable to the public by translating it from chinese to english (as well as updating depricaded libraries and making the resulting data more managable and readable in general).🌐📚
